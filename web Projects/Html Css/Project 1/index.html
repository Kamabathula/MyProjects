                    <h3>Recent Developments</h3>
                    <p>In 2021, the Kerala government settled the case filed against it by Narayanan by agreeing to a payment of â‚¹1.3 crore (US$160,000).[29]

                        On 14 Apr 2021 the Supreme Court of India ordered a CBI probe into the involvement of police officers in the conspiracy.
                        Several of the involved police officers filed petitions in different courts in Kerala in which several documents showing transfer of 
                        lands between 2004 and 2008 by Narayanan to various CBI officers involved in the investigation, were produced.
                        The Kerala High Court dismissed one of the pleas to investigate the land deals.[32] It said that the documents were insufficient proof,
                         but allowed the petitioners to file a fresh case with better sale records</p>
